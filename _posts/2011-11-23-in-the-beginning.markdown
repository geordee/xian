I have been maintaining a personal blog from 2003 or so. Forgot the exact date, but that's the year I registered this domain name. Some years back I have started writing technical articles. And that made me think about my the third personality - spiritual. So here am I. I am going to put down my thoughts, articles and studies. For no special reason. May be as a mark that I would leave behind on this www, world wide web, or in spiritual terms whole wide world.
