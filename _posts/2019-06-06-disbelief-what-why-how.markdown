> When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind." - Mark 3:21

Mark records the story of Jesus in a linear fashion. Jesus' public ministry has surprised people around him. They were in a state of wonder and disbelief.

In the first chapter the response was of awe.

> "What is this? A new teaching—and with authority!".

In the second chapter it turns into questions.

> "Why does this fellow talk like that?"

By the time we reach third chapter we see conclusions, both from family and foes.

> "He is out of his mind."
> "He has an impure spirit."

They were forced to draw conclusions, since they did not want it from Jesus himself. They were, in a way, arrogant of their knowledge - either knowing the person too closely, or knowing the subject too well.

We also run the risk of drawing conclusions, when we are confident or arrogant about spiritual matters. Let us then humble ourselves before the Word, and let Jesus himself explain who he is.
