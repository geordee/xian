The parables are stories with deeper meanings. The beauty of the parable is that it is independent of the local context or time. Still, it was relevant in the time and context when the parable was told.

The parable of the sower _(Mark 4)_ illustrates different responses to the Word of God. Jesus, the Word of God, was among them. Still there were those who believed and those who did not believe.

Those who believed were healed and forgiven. Those who did not believe asked Jesus to leave them _(5:17)_, laughed at him _(5:40)_, took offense at him _(6:3)_. Jesus could not do any miracles among them, due to their lack of faith _(6:5)_.
